# Retrospective Exercise

## Instructions

In the front of the room there are three whiteboards. The left one will be designated for "CONS", or areas in need of improvement. The right board will be designated for "PROs" or areas to be repeated in the future. The middle board will be designated for "advice to future students on how to succeed in this course".

### Identification and Voting Phase

When instructed to do so, use a dry erase marker to add one or more items to any of the three whiteboards.

If you see an existing item on the board that you identify with, place a tally mark next to that item to "vote" for it.

### Discussion Phase

After the designated period of time, the professor will lead discussions about the top vote-getting items.
