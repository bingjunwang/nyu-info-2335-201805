# Unit 12 Recap

Hello students,

As we wrap up the semester, please remember to submit your [Industry Insights assignment](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/assignments/industry-insights/assignment.md) through NYU Classes before end of day Friday.

I aim to post your final exam grades sometime later today or tomorrow, your freestyle project grades sometime this weekend, your industry insights assignment grades by Monday, and your final letter grades by Tuesday.

As I finish grading each of these remaining items, I will be posting announcements to the `#2335` Slack channel.

Stay tuned!

\- Professor Rossetti
