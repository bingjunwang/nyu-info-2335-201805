# Unit 11 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 11 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-11/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 11 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/23189e8d38234567b3e3373c529e45241d).

We spent some time engaging in a "retrospective" exercise to help assess the effectiveness of the course from a student perspective.

Then I shared more information about what to expect on the [Final Exam](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/exams/final/exam.md), which will be administered between 6pm and 7:30pm on Wednesday, during our final class together. :crying_cat_face:

See you then!

\- Professor Rossetti
