Thanks everyone for a great semester. By now all grades have been posted to NYU Classes and final letter grades have been submitted to the registrar.

If you'd like to stay in touch, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerossetti/) and/or email me anytime at prof.mj.rossetti@gmail.com.

Have a great summer! And if you need anything in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.
